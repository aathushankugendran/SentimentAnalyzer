# SentimentClassifier

This project is aimed at performing sentiment analysis on musical instrument reviews using machine learning techniques. The code provided here utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and a Random Forest classifier to predict whether a review expresses positive or negative sentiment about musical instruments.

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the sentiment expressed in text data. In this project, we are specifically focusing on sentiment analysis of reviews related to musical instruments. The goal is to build a model that can automatically classify these reviews as positive or negative based on their content.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- nltk

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk
```

Additionally, you need to download NLTK resources by running the following commands:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the code:

```bash
cd your_repository
```

3. Place your dataset file in the repository. Ensure the dataset is in TSV (Tab-Separated Values) format with columns named "Review" and "Score".

4. Run the provided Python script:

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

5. The script will preprocess the data, train a Random Forest classifier, and evaluate its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Evaluation

After running the code, you will see the evaluation metrics printed in the console:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly predicted instances in the test set.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.

Based on these metrics, you can assess the performance of the sentiment analysis model on your dataset.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis on musical instrument reviews. By leveraging NLP and a Random Forest classifier, we can effectively classify reviews as positive or negative, providing valuable insights into customer sentiment towards musical instruments.

For further improvements, consider exploring different machine learning algorithms, fine-tuning model parameters, or addressing any imbalances in the dataset.
